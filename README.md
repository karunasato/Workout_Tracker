# Workout_Tracker

This application will help the user track their daily fitness progress.

The user is able to view and track their daily workouts.

The main page will display the user's last workout, which will include the information regarding the date, total workout duration, exercise performed, and total distance covered.

From there, the user may choose to continue their workout or add a new workout. When doing so, they will be able to select from the drop down menu the type of exercise resistance or cardio.

If the user logs in resistance exercise, it will allow them to add in the name of the exercise, weights they used, number of sets and reps, and the duration of the exercise.

Once the user fills in the information, they may select "complete" if they are are finished logging in their workout or "add excercise" if they wish to log in additional workouts.

The user may also check the workout dashboard which will show their stats and overview of their workouts throughout the week. This includes the duration, how many pounds they have lifted, and a pie chart to show the stats of which exercises they preformed.
